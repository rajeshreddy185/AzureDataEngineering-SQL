**  SQL FROM **

The SQL FROM clause is a mandatory component of almost every SELECT statement. Its primary purpose is to identify the table or tables from which the data should be retrieved.

In essence, the FROM clause tells the database engine where to look for the columns specified in the SELECT list.

Basic Syntax and Function 
The basic structure places the FROM clause immediately after the SELECT clause:

SQL

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
table_name: The name of the table that contains the columns you are selecting.
