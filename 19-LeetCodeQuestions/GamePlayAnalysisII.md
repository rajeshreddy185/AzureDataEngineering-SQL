Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to determine the number of players who logged in on the day immediately following their initial login, and divide it by the number of total players.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

Output: 

| fraction  |
|-----------|
| 0.33      |

Explanation: 
Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33



```sql
WITH PlayerFirstLogin AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
    FROM
        Activity
    GROUP BY
        player_id 
),
PlayersWithConsecutiveLogin AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        T1.player_id
    FROM
        PlayerFirstLogin AS T1
    INNER JOIN
        Activity AS T2
    ON
        T1.player_id = T2.player_id
    WHERE
        T2.event_date = DATE_ADD(T1.first_login_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
)
SELECT
    ROUND(
        CAST(COUNT(C.player_id) AS NUMERIC) 
        / 
        CAST((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity) AS NUMERIC),
    2) AS fraction
FROM
    PlayersWithConsecutiveLogin AS C;
